	<p style="background-color:black;color:red" border="10px">Many of the texts we rely on in our on-campus classrooms—from textbooks to literature to scholarly articles, to say nothing of images, films, or music—are currently under copyright. So the question then becomes: What does this mean for teaching on the Coursera?

And, again, in short it means a lot of work, either replacing texts with free and widely accessible alternatives or negotiating (and paying for!) licensing permissions for use online.

It bears repeating: This is a time-consuming process, especially as ownership of copyrighted material is sometimes difficult (if not virtually impossible) to trace. But, additionally, we must also keep in mind the structural challenges of negotiating copyright in massive open online environments: current licensing structures for copyright are ill-equipped at best to cover the kinds of massive open use that MOOCs require.

Clear priorities are thus in order about which texts are absolutely essential for use in the course, and which can be replaced. And, in turn, this work of redesign and revision for teaching in massive open online settings requires a good deal of flexibility and creativity across the university—on the part of instructors, designers, experts in copyright, librarians, legal counsel, and administrators—to define the parameters of acceptable risk and available resources.

<p style="background-color:black;color:red" border="100px">While public domain in the United States covers many works published after 1923, it is still best to practice due diligence and caution when selecting course material for use in open online settings.[2]  

Of course, most of us are likely familiar with Google Books (and the scourge of snippet view) and Google Scholar. There are, however, a number of other sites that collect and catalogue texts in the public domain.

    Project Gutenberg offers over 42,000 free ebooks,
    while the Open Library is building a comprehensive open catalogue of library records, in addition to offering free ebooks to download or read online as well as ebooks lending.
    Although WorldCat catalogues both public domain and copyrighted texts, it does enable instructors and students to access the worldwide availability of a given text.
    Finally, Register and Read from JSTOR, currently in beta, is an experimental program offering students read-online access to limited material housed in JSTOR. Importantly, only a selection of the content in JSTOR is eligible for Register and Read.

Further, keep in mind that “deep linking” to material limited to the Vanderbilt network and accessed through Vanderbilt subscriptions (e.g., The New York Times or JSTOR articles not covered by Register and Read), should be avoided. Students outside of the Vanderbilt network will be unable to easily access this material.</p>
